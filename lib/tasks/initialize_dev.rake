  # BUSINESS LOGIC
  # 30 Generic Teacher Accounts for each school (Teacher 1, Teacher 2, Teacher 3, etc.)
  # Each teacher should have two sections (Section 1, Section 2)
  # Each sections should have at 15 students (Last Name, First Name)
  # Each section should have at least 10 learning outcomes
  # 5 of learning outcomes should already be added to the section
    #   Each of the 5 LOs should have 4 pieces of evidence
    #     Of the five,  Two of the LOs and the supporting evidence should be rated
    #         Of the five,  the remaining Three of the LOs should NOT be rated
    #             Of the three not rated LOs, Two of the LOs supporting evidence should be rated
    #                 Of the three not rated LOs, the one remaining LOs supporting evidence should NOT be rated
